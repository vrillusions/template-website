# Template: website

    <html><body>It works</body></html>

Is that what your `index.html` looks like?  Well that looks ugly.  This template will make it look slightly less ugly.

## Design goals

- all the default files needed (`favicon.ico`, `robots.txt`)
- basic CSS ([picnic](https://github.com/picnicss/picnic))
- no external resources

## Usage

Can either clone this project and place the `public` folder somewhere or to download just the archive:

```
wget https://github.com/vrillusions/template-website/archive/master.tar.gz
tar xzf master.tar.gz
mv template-website-master/public /srv/www/example.com/
```

## Test web server

Want to just start a basic web server?

### Python 3

    cd public
    python3 -m http.server 8000 &>>../simpleserver.log &

### Python 2

    cd public
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 &>>../simpleserver.log &

Now you have a web server listening on port 8000 that will happily send any file inside the `public` folder. Use this to setup quick ad hoc file servers. Just create a `files` folder off of `public` and toss all your stuff in there. So long as there isn't an `index.html` it will list the contents of the folder.

It should be obvious but it wouldn't be the best of ideas to run this simple http server on the internet.
